# TC2E-115
The TC2E-115 Paraflex subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

The subwoofer is the downsizes version of the first TC2E-118 subwoofer desing wich is based on a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, therefore the named **Paraflex** was chosen. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the designs of the cabinet and its different versions. 

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for midrange and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
